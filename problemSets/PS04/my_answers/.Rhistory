# Study whether more income = more prestige
# Study whether profs = more prestige than bc or wc
# a) New variable "professional" based on "type"
# I am using mutate() from dplyr, along with ifelse()
# What I am telling R is that the new variable professional
# will take the value 1 if type is equal to "prof" and 0
# if type is anything else.
Prestige <- Prestige %>% mutate(
professional = ifelse(type == "prof", 1,0)
)
# Checking that NAs are still NAs and not 0
# (so I'm coding professional correctly):

# b) Running the first model:
# prestige ~ income + professional + interaction
m1 <- lm(prestige~income+professional+income*professional, Prestige)
