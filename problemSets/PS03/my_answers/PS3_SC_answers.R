#### Question 1 ####

# Creating model using lm (I have used lm a lot in the past): 
model1 <- lm(voteshare~difflog, inc.sub)

# Exploring model
summary(model1)

resid1 <- model1$residuals

# And creating the scatterplot using ggplot:
plot1 <- ggplot(inc.sub, aes(x = difflog, y = voteshare)) +

  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())  # Getting rid of the grid

#Saving plot:

#### Question 2 ####

# Creating and exploring model:  
model2 <- lm(presvote~difflog, inc.sub)

resid2 <- model2$residuals

# And creating the scatterplot using ggplot:

ggsave("plot2.png", plot = plot2, dpi = 300)


#### Question 3 ####

# Creating and exploring model:  
model3 <- lm(voteshare~presvote, inc.sub)
summary(model3)

# Creating the scatterplot using ggplot:
plot3 <- ggplot(inc.sub, aes(x = presvote, y = voteshare)) +

#### Question 4 #### 

# Creating and exploring model:  
model4 <- lm(resid1~resid2, inc.sub)
summary(model4)

# Creating the scatterplot using ggplot:
plot4 <- ggplot(inc.sub, aes(x = resid2, y = resid1)) +
  geom_point(color = "thistle3", alpha = 0.7) +  # Editing point color and transparency

#### Question 5 #### 

# Creating and exploring model:  
model5 <- lm(voteshare~difflog+presvote, inc.sub)
summary(model5)

# Comparing Model 4 and Model 5:
# I think the residuals between the two models are going to be the same
# I will check for this.

# Naming my residuals from both models: 
resid4 <- model4$residuals
resid5 <- model5$residuals

# I see here I can use the function identical (https://statisticsglobe.com/compare-vectors-and-find-differences-in-r)
identical(resid4,resid5) # Not identical 

# But perhaps they are not identical to the very last decimal point,
# however if I give a certain tolerance level (for example 0.001)
# the residuals will be the same.
# Here I see how to create the following function to compare each element
# in my residuals vectors, allowing for a small difference between them 
# (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49237304/compare-two-vectors-of-numbers-based-on-threshold-of-tolerance-Â±-of-0-5)
# And I just have to sum the output
sum(mapply(function(element1, element2) abs(element1 - element2) <= 0.001, 
           resid4, resid5))

# Double checking residuals length -> this means all residuals in M4 and M5 are the same
length(resid4) 
length(resid5)
